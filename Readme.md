# Login system using python.
This is a simple command line Login system I wrote to practice more on using loops and dictionaries, regex among others.

## How It Is Designed
I used dictionary to hold the usernames and passwords. Each username is being mapped together with its passowrd as a key value pair ðŸ¤“.

## Features
1. Sign up
2. Login
3. Change forgotten passwords

## How to use
- Download the code

- type in 'help' to get. instructions on how to access the features.

### Notes:
Each entry has its own requirements binding it such as;
1. Username must have at least a capital letter.
2. Password must be more than or equals to 8 characters consisting of letters, numbers and signs.
3. For signing up: No information is saved if the requirements aren't fulfilled.
4. Once the terminal is closed, all Changes are lost ðŸ˜”
